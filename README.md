Challenge2
Project of simple webpage with the use of Bootstrap. The project is 2nd challenge of Weekly WebDev Challenge (https://www.facebook.com/groups/940002776068923).

Website is made basing on the layout which was given by the organizators as well as photos and text contents. 

The project was created with the use of HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap. That's the first project of mine made with Bootstrap so it has some flaws. 

The app is available on GitHubPages: https://knowakowska.github.io/challenge2/ 

Future ideas:
-- improve the styling and animations
-- showing detials after clicking "view more" button with the use of AJAX
-- better the Bootstrap structure
